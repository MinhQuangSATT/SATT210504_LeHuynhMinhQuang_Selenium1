## Selenium 1 Example

Here is my first Selenium Level 1 course example.

To run any Test case in this project :
- Open this project by Intellij.
- Head to Railway folder inside src/main/Testcases/
- Run any Test Case file you want.

Or if you want to run parallel all Test cases :
- Open testng.xml by Intellij.
- Config the 'thread-count' option as many as you want to run Test Cases as the same time.
- Run testng.xml

To see the report result of test cases , you can :
- If you run parallel , go to test-output/All Test Suite/ , open TestSuite.html by any browser and see the report.
- If you run any individual test case by execute that test case in Testcases/Railway/ , you can go to test-output/Default Suite and open the [Project Name].html by any brower to see the report after executing that test case. 

Note : TC01 may not return welcome message in some computers.
